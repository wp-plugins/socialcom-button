Plugin to add the Social.com Button into your Wordpress posts.

== Description ==

The Social.com Button allows your blog visitors to easily tweet about your posts without leaving the current web page.   The Social.com button is similar in appearance to other buttons, but with a very different feature set (uses the same functionality for users as the Social.com bookmarklet, but in a form which can be inserted into your blog posts).

Social.com uses Bit.ly for URL shortening and makes available their powerful statistics through the Social.com Button (by clicking on the tweet count). 

Plugin Features for Blog Administrator

* Simple installation.
* Control the location of the button (top/bottom) and optionally add positioning style.
* Shows the number of times your post has been tweeted from your blog using the button.
* Choose from 3 button types.
* Customize the button label text (i.e. "tweet", "retweet", etc.)
* Customize an optional prefix for the default message (i.e. RT @yourusername [title] [short url])

Social.com Features for Visitors

* Default button type displays count of tweets. Clicking count shows page of detailed statistics.
* The button opens a mini-window in the center of the blog post. Visitors never leave the blog post page.
* Blog post title and URL (automatically shortened with Bit.ly) inserted as default message.
